The scenario doesn't mention internet exposure, DMZ, or remote access. It's about a local installation, so probably on-site. That would be EXP=2.\n\nNext, vulnerability (VUL). The maturity is \"observed adversarial technique,\" which suggests it's a known TTP. The category is system software, and there's a mention of a malicious module installable. Since there's no mention of a patch or mitigation, this might be VUL=2. Wait, the rules say if there's a vendor advisory or PoC available, it's VUL=2. Here, \"observed adversarial technique\" could mean a TTP is observed, so VUL=2. But if there's no mitigation, maybe it's higher. Wait, the user says \"malicious OS kernel driver installable\" but doesn't mention if a patch is applied. So no mitigation cues, so VUL=2.\n\nImpact (IMP). The impact depends on the effect. If a malicious kernel module is installed, that could allow deep system control. Since it's a DRIVE, maybe it's part of a larger system. The impact could be on process control, leading to actuator manipulation or production stop. That would be IMP=4. If it's just a module install, maybe it's more about system compromise but without direct actuator impact, maybe IMP=3. But the scenario is about a DRIVE, which might be part of a process. Need to check the rules again. IMP=4 is process outage or actuator manipulation. If the module can control actuators, then IMP=4. Otherwise, maybe IMP=3. The scenario doesn't specify the exact impact, but since it's a kernel module, it's a high-level compromise. Let's go with IMP=4 as a higher impact.\n\nSo, EXP=2, VUL=2, IMP=4.

The device in question is a DRIVE, and the vulnerability is HTTP Injection/Response Splitting as per EMB3D's description.\n\nFirst, Exposure (EXP). The scenario mentions HTTP, which typically uses web interfaces. If it's a web service, that might mean it's internet-exposed or at least accessible via a network. However, there's no explicit mention of being on the internet, DMZ, or public IP. It's possible it's on-site, maybe engineering workstations. The scenario doesn't specify if it's air-gapped or behind a firewall. Since HTTP injection is a web-based vulnerability, I might lean towards EXP=3 if it's internet-exposed.

However, the scenario doesn't specify actuator control or process outage. The most likely impact here is visibility/UI loss (IMP=3) if the attacker can alter the user interface or data displayed. If it's just information disclosure without direct control, IMP=2 or 3. Since it's a DRIVE, maybe it's related to motor control. If the HTTP injection allows manipulating control commands, that could lead to uncontrolled motion (IMP=5). But the scenario doesn't specify that.

The device in question is a DRIVE, and the EMB3D details mention a maturity level of \"observed adversarial technique\" under the system software category. The scenario is about a malicious OS kernel driver/module being installable.\n\nFirst, for Exposure (EXP). The scenario doesn't mention anything about the device being internet-exposed, having a public IP, or being accessible via a VPN. It's likely on-site since there's no indication of remote access. The installation of a kernel driver might require physical access or local administrative privileges, which points towards EXP=2 (on-site only, engineering workstation, USB/serial, requires physical presence). There's no mention of it being air-gapped or having a patch applied, so EXP=2 seems right.\n\nNext, Vulnerability (VUL). The EMB3D maturity is \"observed adversarial technique,\" which suggests that the technique has been used by attackers but might not have a public exploit yet. However, the presence of a malicious driver installation could be a known vulnerability. Since there's no mention of a patch or mitigation in the scenario, but the maturity is \"observed,\" that might indicate a vendor advisory or observed TTPs. However, if there's a public exploit, VUL would be 3. But the scenario says \"installable\" which might imply that the vulnerability exists but hasn't been actively exploited yet. Wait, the EMB3D description says \"malicious OS Kernel Driver/Module Installable,\" which is a known technique. If there's a public exploit or PoC available, VUL would be 2. If it's just observed in the wild without a PoC, still VUL=2. Since the maturity is \"observed adversarial technique,\" that aligns with VUL=2 (vendor advisory, observed TTP, PoC available). So VUL=2.\n\nImpact (IMP). A malicious kernel driver could allow deep system compromise. If the driver can control hardware or processes, that could lead to process outages or actuator manipulation. The impact here would be IMP=4 because it's about actuator control or production stop. If it's just affecting the UI or diagnostics, it would be lower, but kernel-level access is more severe. So IMP=4.\n\nPutting it all together: EXP=2, VUL=2, IMP=4.

      "raw_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's break down this scenario step by step. The device in question is a DRIVE, which is a type of industrial drive system. The EMB3D tid is TID-214, and the maturity is at the proof of concept stage. The category is system software, and the scenario involves secrets being extracted from the device's root of trust.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the exposure (EXP). The scenario doesn't mention anything about the device being internet-exposed, having a public IP, or being in a DMZ. It also doesn't specify if it's accessible via a VPN or remote web services. Since the maturity is a proof of concept, it's likely that this is a lab environment or not yet deployed in a real-world setting. Therefore, the exposure is probably low. The most fitting EXP value here is 1, as there's no indication of external exposure or active exploitation vectors beyond a proof of concept.\n\nNext, vulnerability (VUL). The scenario states that secrets were extracted from the root of trust. This suggests a vulnerability exists, but since it's a proof of concept, there's no mention of active exploitation in the wild or a public exploit available. However, because the mitigation cues (like patches or compensating controls) aren't mentioned here, we might lean towards VUL=2 if there's a vendor advisory or TTPs observed. But wait, the scenario says it's a proof of concept, which might imply that the vulnerability is known but not yet weaponized. However, the presence of a proof of concept could indicate that a PoC is available, which according to the rules would make VUL=2. However, if there's no mitigation mentioned, maybe it's VUL=3 if it's actively exploited. But the scenario doesn't state that it's exploited in the wild. Hmm. The EMB3D description might indicate that the vulnerability is present but not yet exploited beyond the proof of concept. So maybe VUL=2 because it's a proof of concept, which is a TTP or PoC available. So VUL=2.\n\nFor impact (IMP), extracting secrets from the root of trust could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation. If the drive is part of a system that controls physical processes, this could lead to actuator manipulation or process outages. However, the scenario doesn't specify the exact impact. The highest possible impact here would be IMP=4 if it leads to process outages or actuator control issues. If it's just about secrets being extracted without immediate operational impact, maybe IMP=3. But given that it's a root of trust compromise, the potential for process outage is significant, so IMP=4 is appropriate.\n\nWait, but the scenario says \"secrets extracted from device root of trust\" but doesn't mention any actual impact on operations. So maybe the impact is lower. However, in OT systems, compromising the root of trust could allow for deeper system compromises, leading to process disruptions. The rules mention that actuator manipulation is IMP=4. If the secrets allow for such manipulation, then IMP=4. Otherwise, if it's just a visibility issue, it would be IMP=3. The scenario doesn't specify the exact impact, but the presence of a root of trust compromise in a DRIVE (which controls motion) could lead to uncontrolled motion, which is IMP=5. However, the scenario doesn't state that uncontrolled motion occurred. It's a proof of concept, so the actual impact might not have been realized yet. Therefore, the impact might be on the lower side. But the rules say to choose the highest applicable. If the vulnerability could lead to actuator manipulation, even if not yet done, then IMP=4. If it's just a security breach without operational impact, maybe IMP=2 or 3. Given that it's a DRIVE, which is part of a control system, the potential for process outage is high, so IMP=4 is the right choice.\n\nPutting it all together: EXP=1 (no external exposure, proof of concept), VUL=2 (PoC available, TTP observed), IMP=4 (potential for process outage via actuator manipulation).\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"ilve\": {\n    \"exposure\": 1,\n    \"vulnerability\": 2,\n    \"impact\": 4\n  },\n  \"justification\": \"Proof of concept with secrets extracted from root of trust \u2192 EXP=1 (no external exposure), VUL=2 (TTP/PoC), IMP=4 (potential actuator/process impact).\"\n}",

Or maybe IMP=3 if it's just visibility loss. But the example with actuator control gives IMP=4, so if the rootkit allows control, it's IMP=4. The scenario says \"operating system susceptible to rootkit,\" which could affect system integrity but not necessarily direct actuator control. Hmm. Maybe IMP=3 as it's system software, but without direct actuator impact. Wait, the example for a rootkit might be considered a system software issue leading to process outage if the OS is compromised. So IMP=4. \n\nPutting it all together: EXP=2 (since no info on internet exposure, but it's on-site?), VUL=3 (exploitable weakness), IMP=4 (process outage).

The maturity is listed as an observed adversarial technique, and the category is system software. The scenario mentions \"Inadequate Bootloader Protection and Verification\" based on EMB3D's description and evidence.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the Exposure (EXP). The scenario doesn't specify if the HMI is internet-exposed or accessible via a DMZ. It just mentions it's an HMI, which is typically on-site. Since there's no mention of being air-gapped or having a firewall blocking access, I might lean towards EXP=2 (on-site only, requires physical presence).

The issue is inadequate bootloader protection.

The EMB3D description might indicate that there's a known vulnerability but no public exploit yet.

      "raw_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's break down this scenario. The device is an HMI (Human-Machine Interface), and the issue is about escaping sandboxed environments as described by EMB3D. \n\nFirst, for Exposure (EXP): The scenario doesn't mention the HMI being internet-exposed, in a DMZ, or accessible via a public IP. It's more about a local or on-site setup. So EXP might be 2 if it's on-site only. But I need to check if there's any mention of exposure. The scenario says it's a proof of concept, which might imply it's not widely exposed. So probably EXP=2.\n\nVulnerability (VUL): The EMB3D categorizes this as a proof of concept. That suggests there's a vulnerability, but no public exploit or active exploitation yet. If there's a proof of concept available, that would be VUL=2. Since there's no mention of a patch or mitigation, but it's a proof of concept, so VUL=2.\n\nImpact (IMP): The HMI's sandbox escape could lead to unauthorized access, which might affect process control. If the HMI is used for monitoring and controlling processes, escaping the sandbox could allow manipulation of the system. However, the scenario doesn't specify if it leads to process outage or safety issues. The impact here might be IMP=3 if it's about visibility/UI loss or operator guidance. But if it's a sandbox escape, maybe it's more about unauthorized access, which could lead to process manipulation. Wait, the example in the rules says actuator manipulation is IMP=4. If the HMI allows manipulation of actuators, then IMP=4. But the scenario doesn't explicitly state that. It just mentions sandbox escape. So maybe it's a visibility issue, leading to IMP=3. Alternatively, if the escape allows control changes, then IMP=4. The EMB3D evidence might indicate the potential for such manipulation. Since the scenario is about escaping a sandbox, which could allow deeper access, I might lean towards IMP=4 if it affects process control. But without explicit mention of actuator control, maybe it's IMP=3. Hmm. The example given in the rules for IMP=3 is visibility/UI loss. If the sandbox escape allows an attacker to bypass UI restrictions, that could be IMP=3. So I'll go with IMP=3.\n\nPutting it all together: EXP=2 (on-site only), VUL=2 (proof of concept available), IMP=3 (visibility/UI loss or operator guidance).

The device in question is an HMI (Human-Machine Interface) with the EMB3D TID-410, categorized under networking and in the proof of concept maturity stage. The scenario mentions a \"Cryptographic Protocol Side Channel\" as per EMB3D's description.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the Exposure (EXP). The scenario doesn't mention the HMI being internet-exposed, DMZ, or accessible via a public IP. Since it's a proof of concept, it's likely not deployed in a production environment yet. However, HMIs are typically on-site devices, possibly connected to a local network. The exposure here might be EXP=2 (on-site only, requires physical presence or local network access). But I need to check if there's any indication of remote access. The scenario doesn't specify, so I'll default to EXP=2.\n\nNext, Vulnerability (VUL). The issue is a side-channel attack in the cryptographic protocol. The EMB3D report might be a vendor advisory or a research finding. Since it's a proof of concept, there's no mention of active exploitation or public exploits. If the vendor has issued an advisory or there's a TTP observed, that would be VUL=2. If there's a mitigation present, like a patch or disabled feature, it would be VUL=1. The scenario doesn't mention any mitigations, so I'll assume VUL=2 based on the advisory or TTP.\n\nImpact (IMP) for an HMI with a cryptographic side channel. If the side channel allows an attacker to extract cryptographic keys, that could lead to unauthorized access or data breaches. However, the impact on operational processes might not be direct. If the HMI's security is compromised, it could lead to unauthorized changes, which might affect process control. But since it's a side-channel in the protocol, the impact might be on data confidentiality rather than process control. The highest applicable impact here might be IMP=3 (visibility/UI loss, operator guidance only) if the attack affects the HMI's interface. However, if the side channel allows for data exfiltration that could lead to further attacks, maybe IMP=2 (degraded convenience, diagnostics only) if it's not directly affecting operations. But I'm a bit uncertain. The EMB3D category is networking, so maybe the impact is on data integrity, but without direct process outage. I'll go with IMP=2 here as a side channel might not immediately cause a process outage but could lead to security issues that degrade the system's trustworthiness.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"ilve\": {\n    \"exposure\": 2,\n    \"vulnerability\": 2,\n    \"impact\": 2\n  },\n  \"justification\": \"On-site HMI with cryptographic side-channel vulnerability in proof of concept stage \u2192 EXP=2 (local access), VUL=2 (vendor advisory/TTP), IMP=2 (security degradation).\"\n}",

The issue is a password retrieval mechanism being abused. The EMB3D category is application software. Since there's a vulnerability being exploited, but the scenario doesn't mention if it's a known CVE or if there's a patch.

In that case, IMP=3 (visibility/UI loss). But if the attacker can take control via the HMI, then IMP=4. Since the scenario is about password retrieval, which could lead to unauthorized access, but the actual impact depends on what the HMI controls. If the HMI has actuator control, then IMP=4.

The key here is \"unpatchable\" and \"device vulnerabilities.\" Since there's no mitigation present (like a patch applied or a disabled feature), and given that the maturity is \"observed adversarial behavior,\" this suggests that there's active exploitation or at least a known vulnerability being targeted. The category is system software, so maybe a known CVE. But since it's unpatchable, the VUL would be 3 if there's active exploitation.

The issue is improper password storage, which is a known exploitable weakness. There's no mention of a patch or mitigation. The EMB3D maturity is \"known exploitable weakness,\" so maybe VUL is 2? Wait, the rules say if there's a vendor advisory or observed TTP, it's VUL=2. Since it's a known exploitable weakness, that could be a vendor advisory. But the example mentions \"active exploitation\" as VUL=3. Here, it's just a known weakness, so VUL=2.\n\nImpact (IMP). Improper password storage could lead to unauthorized access, which might allow an attacker to manipulate the PLC. If the PLC controls actuators, that could cause a process outage (IMP=4). But the scenario doesn't specify if there's a direct impact on process control. The problem is with password storage, which is more about access. If an attacker gains access, maybe they can take control. But without more info, maybe IMP=3 (visibility/UI loss) or IMP=2. Wait, the impact is based on the vulnerability's potential. Since improper password storage could allow unauthorized access, which could lead to operator guidance being bypassed. But the actual impact depends on what the attacker can do. If the PLC's password storage is weak, an attacker could log in and change settings, leading to actuator manipulation. So IMP=4. Hmm, but the scenario doesn't mention actuator control. Maybe IMP=3? The example for IMP=3 includes operator guidance. If the attacker can access the PLC, they might manipulate the operator interface, leading to visibility loss. Alternatively, if they can take control of the process, it's IMP=4. Since the scenario is about password storage, the direct impact is on access. If access is gained, the impact depends on what's possible. The problem is that the scenario doesn't specify the exact impact. Since it's a PLC, the impact could be high if the attacker can manipulate the process. But without explicit info on actuator control, maybe IMP=3 is safer. Wait, the rules say to choose the highest applicable.

Since there's no indication of remote access, EXP is likely 2 (on-site only).\n\nNext, vulnerability (VUL). The problem is that rollbacks are allowed. There's no mention of active exploitation, weaponized CVE, or PoC.

The example given in the rules for IMP=4 is process outage or actuator manipulation. If the rollback allows an attacker to take control, that's IMP=4. But the scenario states \"Firmware Update Rollbacks Allowed\" as the issue. So the impact would be if someone exploits that to roll back and then attack. But the immediate impact of the vulnerability itself is allowing the rollback. If the rollback is exploited to cause a process outage, then IMP=4. But the scenario doesn't mention that. So maybe IMP=3, as it's more about operator guidance. Alternatively, if the rollback itself could lead to a process stop by reverting to a non-functional firmware, then IMP=4.

The maturity is an observed adversarial technique, which probably means it's been seen in real attacks. The category is application software. The scenario mentions \"Remotely Accessible Unauthenticated Services\" according to EMB3D.\n\nFirst, for Exposure (EXP). The key phrase here is \"Remotely Accessible.\" That usually means the service is exposed beyond the local network. Since it's a PLC, which is an OT device, if it's remotely accessible, that could be via a DMZ, public IP, or through a VPN. The example in the rules mentions EXP=3 for internet-exposed or DMZ. So EXP is likely 3 here.\n\nNext, Vulnerability (VUL). The scenario says \"Unauthenticated Services.\" That implies there's a lack of authentication, which is a vulnerability. But the rules state that if there's a mitigation, VUL is 1. However, the scenario doesn't mention any mitigations like patches or disabled features. The EMB3D maturity is \"observed adversarial technique,\" which under the rules would correspond to VUL=2 (vendor advisory, observed TTP, PoC). But wait, the example in the rules for VUL=3 is active exploitation or weaponized CVE. Since it's an observed adversarial technique, maybe that's VUL=2. Wait, the EMB3D description might be more about TTPs (tactics, techniques, procedures) being observed, which fits VUL=2. But if there's a public exploit available, it would be VUL=3. The scenario doesn't mention an exploit, just that it's an observed technique. So VUL=2.\n\nImpact (IMP). The PLC is involved, and if it's a PLC with unauthenticated services, an attacker could potentially manipulate the process. That would lead to a process outage or actuator manipulation. According to the rules, IMP=4 for process outage or actuator manipulation. The example in the worked examples where actuator control was possible led to IMP=4. So IMP=4 here.\n\nPutting it all together: EXP=3 (remotely accessible), VUL=2 (observed TTP), IMP=4 (process outage risk).\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"ilve\": { \"exposure\": 3, \"vulnerability\": 2, \"impact\": 4 },\n  \"justification\": \"Remotely accessible unauthenticated PLC services with observed adversarial TTPs \u2192 EXP=3, VUL=2, IMP=4.\"\n}",
