The EMB3D maturity is a proof of concept, and the category is system software.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the MITIGATIONS. The scenario doesn't mention any explicit mitigations like patches applied, services disabled, or firewalls blocking access. So, according to rule A, there are no mitigations to override. \n\nNext, CONNECTIVITY (EXP). The scenario doesn't specify remote access. It just says \"untrusted programs can access,\" which could be local. Since there's no mention of remote reachability (like internet or DMZ), EXP is likely 2 (on-site only). Rule B says not to assume remote without explicit text, so EXP=2.\n\nVULNERABILITY (VUL). The EMB3D maturity is a proof of concept, which under rule 3 would be VUL=2. There's no mention of active exploitation in the wild, just a lab PoC. So VUL=2.\n\nIMPACT (IMP). The scenario mentions privileged OS functions being accessed. Since it's a DRIVE, this could affect process control. However, the impact isn't specified as safety hazard or process outage. It's more about system software, so maybe IMP=3 (visibility/UI loss or operator guidance). But the description says \"untrusted programs can access privileged OS functions,\" which might allow manipulation. If there's no explicit safety or process impact, IMP might be 3 or 4. But the scenario doesn't mention actuator manipulation or production stop. So IMP=3.\n\nCalculating LIKELIHOOD: EXP (2) + VUL (2) -1 = 3. Clamped to 3.

      "raw_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this scenario step by step. The device in question is a DRIVE, and the EMB3D information mentions unpatchable vulnerabilities in the device software. The maturity level is observed adversarial behavior, and the category is system software.\n\nFirst, I need to check for explicit mitigations. The scenario says the vulnerabilities are unpatchable. That's a key point. Since there's no patch applied or service disabled, there's no explicit mitigation. So MITIGATION OVERRIDE rule doesn't apply here because there's no mention of a patch or mitigation. So we move to the next steps.\n\nNext, determine connectivity (EXP). The scenario doesn't mention remote access, public IPs, or anything indicating remote reachability. It just says \"device software\" with unpatchable issues. Without explicit remote cues, EXP can't be 3. So EXP is either 1 or 2. The scenario doesn't state it's air-gapped or isolated, so EXP is 2 (on-site only, engineering WS, etc.).\n\nVULNERABILITY (VUL): The scenario mentions \"observed adversarial behavior\" and \"unpatchable vulnerabilities\". Since there's no patch and the vulnerabilities are unpatchable, and there's observed adversarial behavior (which could imply exploitation), VUL would be 2. Because vendor advisory or observed TTPs (adversarial behavior) are present, and no effective mitigation. If it was actively exploited, VUL would be 3, but the scenario says \"observed adversarial behavior\" which might mean exploitation is possible but not confirmed as active. So VUL=2.\n\nIMPACT (IMP): The device is a DRIVE. The impact depends on the consequences. Since it's a drive, possible impact could be process outage or actuator manipulation. The scenario doesn't specify safety hazards or process outages, but given it's a drive, maybe IMP=4 (process outage). However, the scenario doesn't explicitly state the impact. Since there's no explicit safety or process effect, maybe IMP is lower. But the category is system software, and unpatchable vulnerabilities in system software could lead to process issues. Without explicit mention, maybe IMP=3 (visibility/UI loss) but that's a stretch. Wait, the scenario doesn't specify the impact, so we have to go by what's given. Since it's a drive, and unpatchable, maybe the impact is on process. But without explicit mention of process outage, maybe IMP=3. However, the example where PoC exists and process impact is there leads to IMP=4. Since the scenario mentions adversarial behavior, which could imply process impact. Hmm. Let's go with IMP=4 as a possible process outage.\n\nCalculating LIK: EXP=2, VUL=2. So LIK_raw = 2+2-1=3. Clamped to 3. So likelihood is 3.\n\nRisk_raw = IMP (4) * LIK (3) = 12. According to the dataset bins, 12 maps to risk=3. So variant is \"threat\".\n\nWait, but let me check again. The scenario says \"unpatchable vulnerabilities\" and \"observed adversarial behavior\". Adversarial behavior could mean active exploitation. If VUL is 3 (actively exploited), then VUL=3. But the rule says VUL=3 if actively exploited. The scenario says \"observed adversarial behavior\" which might indicate active exploitation. If that's the case, VUL=3. Then EXP=2, so LIK_raw=2+3-1=4. Clamped to 4. IMP=4 (assuming process outage). Risk_raw=4*4=16. According to the bins, 15-16 maps to risk=4. So variant is threat. But the initial analysis considered VUL=2. Let me reevaluate.\n\nThe key is whether \"observed adversarial behavior\" implies active exploitation. The rules state that VUL=3 requires \"actively exploited / weaponized CVE / exploited in the wild / confirmed working exploit in production without effective mitigation\". The scenario says \"observed adversarial behavior\" which might mean that the adversary is using the vulnerability. So that would make VUL=3. But if the adversarial behavior is just observed attempts, not successful exploitation, then VUL=2. The wording is a bit ambiguous. Since the scenario says \"observed adversarial behavior\", which could mean active exploitation is happening. So VUL=3.\n\nIf VUL=3, EXP=2, then LIK_raw=2+3-1=4. Clamped to 4. IMP=4 (assuming process outage). Risk_raw=4*4=16. Bins map 15-16 to risk=4. So variant is threat. But the user's example 4 has VUL=3 when exploited. So I think in this case, VUL=3 is correct. Let's adjust.\n\nSo recalculating:\n\nVUL=3 (actively exploited), EXP=2 (local), IMP=4 (process outage). LIK=4. Risk_raw=16 \u2192 risk=4. Variant is threat.\n\nBut wait, the scenario says \"Device Vulnerabilities Unpatchable\". The EMB3D description says \"unpatchable\", so no mitigation. The adversarial behavior observed could be exploitation. So VUL=3. Then EXP=2 (local only, no remote). IMP=4 (process outage). So the final result would be:\n\nilve: impact=4, likelihood=4, vulnerability=3, exposure=2.\n\nRisk_raw=16 \u2192 risk=4. Variant=threat.\n\nBut let me check the rules again. The scenario doesn't explicitly state that the exploit is active. \"Observed adversarial behavior\" could be attempts or exploitation. If it's just attempts, then VUL=2. But if it's active exploitation, then VUL=3. The rules say to prefer lower risk if uncertain. However, the maturity is \"observed adversarial behavior\", which might imply active exploitation. So VUL=3 is more accurate here.\n\nTherefore, the final JSON should reflect these values.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"variant\": \"threat\",\n  \"risk\": 4,\n  \"ilve\": {\n    \"impact\": 4,\n    \"likelihood\": 4,\n    \"vulnerability\": 3,\n    \"exposure\": 2\n  },\n  \"risk_raw\": 16,\n  \"justification\": \"VUL=3 (observed adversarial behavior implies active exploitation), EXP=2 (no remote cues), IMP=4 (unpatchable system software in drive likely impacts process control).\",\n  \"rule_consistency\": {\n    \"likelihood_equals_exposure_plus_vulnerability_minus_1\": true\n  },\n  \"calc\": {\n    \"exp\": 2,\n    \"vul\": 3,\n    \"impact\": 4,\n    \"likelihood_raw\": 4,\n    \"likelihood_clamped\": 4,\n    \"risk_raw\": 16\n  }\n}",

The device type is a DRIVE, and the EMB3D details mention a \"proof of concept\" maturity level with the category being system software. The scenario describes a vulnerability related to the extraction of shared secrets used in firmware/software update integrity.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the mitigation status. The scenario doesn't mention any explicit mitigations like patches applied, services disabled, or compensating controls. So, there's no MITIGATION OVERRIDE here. That means we can't set VUL to 1 based on mitigation.\n\nNext, exposure (EXP). The scenario doesn't specify remote reachability. It's a proof of concept, which typically implies it's in a lab environment. Since there's no mention of remote access or public exposure, EXP would be 2 (on-site only). However, since it's a proof of concept, maybe it's local. But the rules say to prefer EXP 1 or 2 if remote isn't explicitly stated. The scenario doesn't say it's remote, so EXP=2.\n\nVulnerability (VUL): The maturity is \"proof of concept,\" which according to the rules, falls under VUL=2 (Vendor advisory, PoC in lab). There's no mention of active exploitation or weaponized CVE, so VUL=2.\n\nImpact (IMP): The vulnerability is about shared secrets extraction, which could affect the integrity of updates. This might lead to unauthorized firmware changes, potentially impacting process control. However, the scenario doesn't mention safety hazards or process outages. It's more about the integrity, which could be a process outage if exploited. So IMP=3 (Visibility/UI loss or operator guidance). But wait, if the shared secrets are extracted, an attacker could alter firmware, leading to actuator manipulation. But the scenario doesn't explicitly state that. The impact here is more about the potential for future exploitation. Since the impact is not directly stated as process outage, maybe IMP=2 (Diagnostics/minor inconvenience) or 3. The scenario says \"per EMB3D description/evidence,\" which might imply a lower impact. Let's go with IMP=2.\n\nCalculating LIK: EXP=2, VUL=2. Likelihood_raw = 2 + 2 -1 = 3. Clamped to 3.

The scenario mentions that the vulnerability is a proof of concept (emb3d_maturity: proof of concept). There's no explicit mention of a patch applied, service disabled, or any mitigation in place. So according to Rule 1, since there's no mitigation mentioned, VUL would be higher. Since it's a PoC, Rule 3 says VUL is 2 because it's a lab PoC. \n\nNext, exposure (EXP). The scenario doesn't specify remote access. The device type is DRIVE, but there's no mention of it being reachable via internet, VPN, etc. So EXP would be 2 (on-site only, maybe via USB or physical presence). \n\nImpact (IMP) is about the consequences.

But the category is system software, and the scenario says \"per EMB3D description/evidence.\" Since there's observed adversarial behavior, that might push VUL to 3 (actively exploited). \n\nImpact (IMP). The vulnerability is firmware rollbacks. If an attacker can roll back firmware, that could allow executing old, vulnerable versions. This might lead to unauthorized access or control, which could affect process operations. But the scenario doesn't mention safety hazards or process outages. It's a system software issue, so maybe IMP is 3 (visibility/UI loss) or 4 (process outage). Since firmware rollback could allow exploitation leading to process issues, maybe IMP is 4.\n\nCalculating likelihood: EXP=2, VUL=3. Likelihood_raw = 2+3-1=4. Clamped to 4. Risk_raw = 4 * IMP. If IMP is 4, risk_raw=16. According to the dataset bins, 15-16 maps to 4, so risk is 4. Variant is \"threat\" since risk is >2.\n\nWait, let me check again. The scenario says \"observed adversarial behavior,\" which indicates exploitation. So VUL=3. EXP is 2 (no remote). IMP: firmware rollback could allow re-exploitation of old vulnerabilities. If that leads to process manipulation, IMP=4. So IMP=4. Then risk_raw=4*4=16 \u2192 risk=4. Variant is threat. \n\nRule consistency: likelihood is 4, which is EXP+VUL-1=2+3-1=4.

That means we proceed to assess the exposure, vulnerability, and impact based on the given cues.\n\nNext, EXPOSURE (EXP). The scenario doesn't specify if the device is remote or local. Since there's no mention of remote access (like internet, DMZ, etc.), we default to EXP=1 or 2. But wait, the device is a DRIVE. Typically, drives might be local, but without explicit info, we can't assume. The scenario says \"system software,\" which could be on-site. So EXP=2 (on-site only, engineering WS, etc.).\n\nVULNERABILITY (VUL). The maturity is \"known exploitable weakness,\" and the category is system software. Since there's no mention of active exploitation or a patch, the VUL would be 2. The EMB3D category suggests it's a confirmed vulnerability but not yet exploited in the wild. So VUL=2.\n\nIMPACT (IMP). The vulnerability is a rootkit in the OS. Rootkits can lead to unauthorized access and control. Since it's a DRIVE, if compromised, it might affect process operations. However, the scenario doesn't specify process outage or safety issues. The impact here is probably on system integrity, but without explicit process or safety cues, IMP would be 3 (visibility/UI loss or operator guidance).

The scenario mentions it's unpatchable, so there's no explicit mitigation like a patch applied or service disabled. That means we can't apply the MITIGATION OVERRIDE rule here because there's no effective mitigation. Since there's no mitigation, we need to check if there's any evidence of current exploitation. The scenario doesn't mention active exploitation, so VUL would be 2 (Vendor advisory confirmed or reliable PoC) because it's a known exploitable weakness but not currently exploited.\n\nNext, EXPOSURE (EXP). The scenario doesn't specify remote reachability. There's no mention of internet, DMZ, public IP, etc. So according to the rules, if remote isn't explicitly stated, EXP can't be 3. The default would be 2 (on-site only). But wait, the scenario says \"Unpatchable Hardware Root of Trust\"\u2014does that imply any specific connectivity? The problem statement doesn't specify, so we default to EXP=2.\n\nIMPACT (IMP).

First, I need to determine the exposure (EXP). The scenario doesn't mention remote access or any network exposure. It just says the device leaks info in logs. Since there's no explicit remote reachability, EXP should be 1 or 2. But since the logs are local, maybe EXP is 2 (on-site only).\n\nNext, vulnerability (VUL). The maturity is \"known exploitable weakness,\" which suggests it's a confirmed vulnerability. But there's no mention of active exploitation or a patch. The category is system software, and the scenario doesn't state if a mitigation is in place. So VUL might be 2 because it's a known vulnerability but not actively exploited yet.\n\nImpact (IMP) is about the consequence. Leaking security info in logs could be a diagnostic issue, maybe allowing an attacker to gather info if they have access. But since it's just logs, IMP is probably 2 (diagnostics/minor inconvenience).\n\nNow, check for mitigations. The scenario doesn't mention any mitigations like patches or services disabled. So MITIGATION OVERRIDE doesn't apply here. \n\nCalculating likelihood: EXP (2) + VUL (2) -1 = 3. Clamped to 3. Risk is IMP (2) * likelihood (3) = 6. According to the bins, 6 maps to risk 2.

So EXP could be 1. Let me recheck. The rules say if remote isn't explicitly stated, choose 1 or 2. Since logs are typically accessed locally, EXP=1. Then VUL=2, IMP=2. Likelihood raw is 1+2-1=2. Risk is 2*2=4, which maps to risk 1. Variant is benign. \n\nBut the initial scenario says \"DRIVE software: Device leaks security information in logs\".

      "raw_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's break this down step by step. The device is a DRIVE, and the issue is incorrect certificate verification leading to authentication bypass. The EMB3D maturity is \"known exploitable weakness,\" which might indicate that there's a confirmed vulnerability.\n\nFirst, check for MITIGATIONS. The scenario doesn't mention any applied patches, disabled services, or compensating controls. So no explicit mitigation here. That means we can't apply the mitigation override rule to set VUL to 1. So we need to assess based on other factors.\n\nNext, determine CONNECTIVITY (EXP). The scenario doesn't specify remote access. It just says \"DRIVE software,\" which could be local or remote. Since there's no explicit mention of remote reachability (like internet, DMZ, etc.), we can't assume it's remote. So EXP is either 1 or 2. But the problem is authentication bypass, which could be local or remote. Since it's not specified, we default to the lowest possible, which is EXP=1 or 2. Wait, the rules say if remote isn't explicitly stated, prefer EXP \u2208 {1,2}. But without more info, maybe EXP=2 (on-site only) if it's local. However, certificate verification issues can be exploited remotely if the service is exposed. Since the scenario doesn't specify, maybe EXP=2 as on-site only. Hmm, but without explicit text, we can't assume remote. So EXP=2 (on-site) if it's local. But I'm a bit unsure here. Let me check the rules again. The rule says if remote isn't explicitly stated, choose EXP \u2208 {1,2}, not 3. So since the scenario doesn't mention remote, we can't set EXP=3. So EXP is either 1 or 2. If the authentication bypass requires physical presence or on-site access, then EXP=2. If it's air-gapped, EXP=1. But the scenario doesn't mention air-gapped. So EXP=2.\n\nVUL is next. The EMB3D maturity is \"known exploitable weakness,\" which suggests a confirmed vulnerability. Since there's no mitigation, and it's a known exploitable weakness, VUL=2 (Vendor advisory confirmed or reliable PoC). Since it's not stated as actively exploited, but it's a known exploitable weakness, VUL=2.\n\nIMPACT: The vulnerability allows authentication bypass. What's the impact? If it's a DRIVE (probably a drive motor or something), authentication bypass could allow unauthorized access, leading to potential process manipulation. The impact would be on process control. If it's a drive, maybe it's part of a larger system. The problem is that without specific consequences mentioned, like safety hazard or process outage, we have to default to lower impact. The scenario says \"Incorrect Certificate Verification Allows Authentication Bypass.\" This could allow an attacker to gain access, but the actual impact isn't specified. If it's just authentication, maybe it's a visibility/UI issue (IMP=3). But if the authentication bypass leads to unauthorized control, that could be process outage (IMP=4). However, the scenario doesn't specify that. So we have to go with the lowest possible. Since the impact isn't explicitly a process outage or safety hazard, maybe IMP=3 (Visibility/UI loss). But wait, the EMB3D category is application software, so maybe it's a software component. If the authentication bypass allows unauthorized access to the application, but the impact isn't on process control, then IMP=3. But without explicit mention of process or safety, IMP=3 is the highest we can go.\n\nNow calculate LIK: EXP=2, VUL=2. Likelihood raw is EXP + VUL -1 = 2+2-1=3. Clamped to 3. So LIK=3.\n\nRisk raw is IMP * LIK = 3 * 3 = 9. According to the dataset bins, 9 maps to risk=3. So variant is \"threat\" since risk is 3.\n\nCheck the rules again for consistency. The mitigation override doesn't apply here because there's no explicit mitigation. VUL is 2 because it's a known exploitable weakness. EXP is 2 (on-site only). IMP is 3 (Visibility/UI). Likelihood is 3. Risk is 3, so variant is threat.\n\nSo the final JSON should reflect these values.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"variant\": \"threat\",\n  \"risk\": 3,\n  \"ilve\": {\n    \"impact\": 3,\n    \"likelihood\": 3,\n    \"vulnerability\": 2,\n    \"exposure\": 2\n  },\n  \"risk_raw\": 9,\n  \"justification\": \"EXP=2 (on-site only, no remote access evidence), VUL=2 (known exploitable weakness, no mitigation), IMP=3 (authentication bypass likely impacts UI/access control).\",\n  \"rule_consistency\": {\n    \"likelihood_equals_exposure_plus_vulnerability_minus_1\": true\n  },\n  \"calc\": {\n    \"exp\": 2,\n    \"vul\": 2,\n    \"impact\": 3,\n    \"likelihood_raw\": 3,\n    \"likelihood_clamped\": 3,\n    \"risk_raw\": 9\n  }\n}",

The problem is about unauthorized messages or connections, but there's no explicit mention of remote access. It could be either remote or local. Since the rule says to prefer EXP 1 or 2 if remote isn't explicitly stated, I need to see if there's any hint. The term \"connections\" might imply network access, but without specifics like internet or DMZ, I can't assume remote. So EXP might be 2 (on-site) unless there's more info.

      "raw_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a scenario about a DRIVE device with unpatchable vulnerabilities. First, I need to apply the rules step by step.\n\nStarting with MITIGATION OVERRIDE. The scenario says the vulnerabilities are unpatchable. So, there's no explicit mitigation like a patch applied. That means rule 1A doesn't apply here. Since there's no mitigation, we move on to check if there's active exploitation. The scenario mentions \"observed adversarial behavior,\" which might indicate active exploitation. But the exact wording isn't \"actively exploited\" or \"weaponized CVE.\" Hmm, maybe it's a TTP observed, so VUL could be 2 according to rule 3.\n\nNext, EXPOSURE (EXP). The scenario doesn't mention remote access. It's a DRIVE, which I assume is on-site. No mention of internet/VPN/DMZ. So EXP is 2 (on-site only). \n\nVULNERABILITY (VUL). The scenario states \"Device Vulnerabilities Unpatchable\" and \"observed adversarial behavior.\" That sounds like a vendor advisory confirmed or observed TTP. So VUL is 2. Since there's no effective mitigation and possible exploitation, but not confirmed active in the wild. \n\nIMPACT (IMP). The device is a DRIVE. If exploited, could it cause process outage? Maybe. But the scenario doesn't specify safety or process impact. It's a system software vulnerability. So IMP might be 3 (visibility/UI loss) unless there's more. Since there's no explicit safety or process impact, IMP is 3.\n\nCalculating LIKELIHOOD: EXP (2) + VUL (2) -1 = 3. Clamped to 3. So LIK is 3.\n\nRISK_RAW is IMP (3) * LIK (3) = 9. According to the bins, 9 maps to risk 3. So variant is \"threat\".\n\nCheck rule consistency: 2+2-1=3, which is correct.

That means MITIGATION OVERRIDE doesn't apply here. So VUL can't be 1 due to mitigation. The maturity is \"known exploitable weakness\", and the category is system software. But no mention of active exploitation, so maybe VUL is 2? Wait, rule 3 for VUL: if there's a vendor advisory or PoC, it's 2. Since it's a known exploitable weakness, maybe that counts as a vendor advisory or observed TTP? So VUL would be 2.\n\nNext, EXPOSURE (EXP). The scenario doesn't mention remote access. The device type is DRIVE, but no info on connectivity. The rules say if remote isn't explicitly stated, choose 1 or 2. Since it's a DRIVE, maybe it's on-site or requires physical access. So EXP=2 (on-site only).\n\nIMPACT (IMP). The vulnerability is in the Hardware Root of Trust. If exploited, could that lead to process outage or safety issues? The scenario doesn't specify, but system software vulnerabilities in drives could affect operation. However, the example mentions \"no operational effect\" for IMP=1. But since it's a root of trust, maybe it's more severe. Wait, the rules say to base IMP only on scenario consequences. The scenario only states it's unpatchable and a known weakness. No explicit process outage or safety hazard. So IMP might be 2 (diagnostics/minor) unless there's more. But maybe the impact is higher. Wait, the example 4 had actuator stop as IMP=4. If this is a root of trust, maybe it allows unauthorized control, leading to process outage. But the scenario doesn't specify that. So without explicit info, IMP should be low.

The EMB3D maturity is \"known exploitable weakness,\" and the category is system software.\n\nFirst, I need to check for any explicit mitigations. The scenario doesn't mention any patches applied, services disabled, or compensating controls. So, no mitigation is present here. That affects the VUL score. Since the vulnerability is known and exploitable, but there's no mention of active exploitation, VUL might be 2. Wait, the maturity is \"known exploitable weakness,\" which could imply a vendor advisory or PoC, so maybe VUL is 2.\n\nNext, exposure (EXP). The scenario doesn't specify if the device is remotely accessible. It just says \"DRIVE software,\" so unless stated otherwise, EXP should be 1 or 2. Since there's no mention of remote access, I'll go with EXP=2 (on-site only). \n\nImpact (IMP) is about the effect. Leaking security info in logs might be a diagnostics issue.

The scenario is about a DRIVE device with the EMB3D TID-301, which is categorized under application software and has an observed adversarial technique. The scenario mentions that the DRIVE software's application binaries have been modified. \n\nFirst, I need to determine the mitigation. The problem statement doesn't mention any explicit mitigations like patches applied or services disabled. So, no MITIGATION OVERRIDE here. That means I can't set VUL to 1 based on mitigation. \n\nNext, EXPOSURE (EXP). The scenario doesn't specify remote access. It just says the software is modified. Since there's no mention of remote connectivity like internet, DMZ, or public IP, EXP is likely 2 (on-site only). Unless there's something else, but the scenario is vague here.\n\nVULNERABILITY (VUL). The EMB3D maturity is \"observed adversarial technique,\" which suggests that the vulnerability has been used in attacks. According to the rules, if it's actively exploited or weaponized, VUL should be 3. But the scenario says \"applications binaries modified\" which might indicate exploitation. So VUL is probably 3.\n\nIMPACT (IMP). The device is a DRIVE, which could be part of a process control system. Modified binaries might affect process operations. The scenario doesn't mention safety hazards or process outages directly, but since it's a DRIVE (could be a motor drive), a compromise might lead to actuator manipulation or production stop. So IMP could be 4. If there's no explicit mention of safety, then 4 is the highest applicable.\n\nCalculating LIKELIHOOD: EXP (2) + VUL (3) -1 = 4. Clamped to 4 (since max is 5). So LIK is 4.\n\nRISK_RAW is IMP (4) * LIK (4) = 16. According to the bins, 15-16 maps to risk 4. So variant is \"threat\" since risk is 4.\n\nNow check the rules again.

If there was active exploitation, it would be 3, but the scenario doesn't say that.\n\nIMPACT (IMP): The device is a DRIVE, which is a motor drive. Unauthorized messages could affect actuator control, leading to process outage or safety issues. The EMB3D description doesn't specify safety, but \"unauthorized connections\" might imply process disruption. So IMP could be 4 (process outage) unless there's a safety hazard mentioned. The scenario doesn't mention safety, so maybe IMP is 3 or 4. Wait, the example for IMP 4 includes actuator manipulation. If unauthorized messages can manipulate the drive, that's a process outage. So IMP=4.\n\nNow, calculate LIK: EXP=2, VUL=2. Likelihood_raw = 2+2-1=3. Clamped to 3. Risk_raw = 4*3=12. According to the bins, 12 maps to risk=3. Variant is \"threat\" since risk is >2.\n\nCheck rule consistency: likelihood should be 3, which is 2+2-1=3.

The rules say to default to EXP 1 or 2 if remote isn't explicitly stated. Since there's no mention of remote, maybe it's on-site. But wait, HMIs can sometimes be accessed remotely.

But wait, the maturity is \"known exploitable weakness,\" which might indicate a confirmed vulnerability. But without active exploitation, it's probably VUL=2.

The scenario says \"unencrypted SW/FW Updates\" but there's no mention of a patch applied, service disabled, or any compensating controls. So, no explicit mitigations here. That means I can't apply the mitigation override rule (Rule 1) to set VUL to 1. \n\nNext, determine exposure (EXP). The scenario doesn't mention remote access, public IPs, or anything like that. It's just about unencrypted updates. Since there's no explicit remote connectivity, EXP should be 2 (on-site only, USB, etc.) unless there's a reason to think it's remote. But the scenario doesn't say so, so EXP=2.\n\nVulnerability (VUL) is based on the maturity being \"proof of concept\". According to Rule 3, a PoC in the lab would make VUL=2. Since there's no mention of active exploitation or weaponized CVE, it's not VUL=3. So VUL=2.\n\nImpact (IMP) is about the consequences. Unencrypted updates could lead to tampering, but the scenario doesn't specify process outage, safety issues, or actuator manipulation. It's more about the update mechanism being insecure. So IMP would be 2 (diagnostics/minor inconvenience) unless there's more. Since it's system software, maybe there's a higher impact, but the scenario doesn't state any specific process or safety effects. So IMP=2.\n\nNow, calculate likelihood. EXP=2, VUL=2.

The task is to apply the given rules and output a JSON object with specific fields.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the exposure (EXP). The scenario doesn't mention remote access. It just says the HMI software allows firmware rollbacks. Since there's no explicit mention of remote reachability, EXP should be 1 or 2. But the device type is HMI, which is typically on-site. So EXP is 2 (on-site only).\n\nNext, mitigation. The scenario doesn't state any mitigations applied. It's about a vulnerability (firmware rollback allowed), so according to the rules, if there's no mitigation, VUL would be higher. Since it's an observed adversarial behavior, but no mention of active exploitation, maybe VUL is 2. Wait, the maturity is \"observed adversarial behavior,\" which might indicate that it's in the wild but not necessarily actively exploited. So VUL is 2 (vendor advisory or observed TTP).\n\nFor impact (IMP), firmware rollbacks could allow reverting to a previous version, which might have vulnerabilities.

      "raw_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this scenario step by step. The device in question is an HMI (Human-Machine Interface) with an unpatchable Hardware Root of Trust as described by EMB3D. The maturity is \"known exploitable weakness,\" and the category is system software.\n\nFirst, I need to check for any explicit mitigations. The scenario mentions \"unpatchable,\" so there's no patch applied. There's no mention of service disabled, air-gapped, or firewall rules, so no mitigations here. That means we can't apply the MITIGATION OVERRIDE rule for VUL=1. Since there's no mitigation, we have to look at the vulnerability level based on other factors.\n\nNext, exposure (EXP). The scenario doesn't specify if the HMI is remotely accessible. It just says \"HMI software.\" Without explicit mention of remote access (like internet, VPN, DMZ, etc.), I should default to EXP=2 (on-site only). But wait, the problem says \"unpatchable Hardware Root of Trust\" which might imply it's a local hardware component. So EXP=2 makes sense here.\n\nVulnerability (VUL) is determined by whether it's actively exploited. The maturity is \"known exploitable weakness,\" which might suggest that it's a known vulnerability but not necessarily actively exploited. However, the category is system software, and the EMB3D description might indicate that it's a weakness that could be exploited. Since the scenario doesn't explicitly state that it's being exploited in the wild or that there's a working exploit, VUL=2 (Vendor advisory confirmed or reliable PoC in lab). The \"known exploitable weakness\" likely falls under this category.\n\nImpact (IMP) needs to be determined based on the consequences. The HMI is part of the system software, but the scenario doesn't mention process outage, safety hazards, or actuator manipulation. It's an HMI, so maybe it's UI-related. If the HMI is compromised, it might affect operator guidance or visibility, leading to IMP=3 (Visibility/UI loss). There's no mention of process stop or safety issues, so IMP=3 is appropriate.\n\nCalculating likelihood: EXP=2, VUL=2. Likelihood raw is 2+2-1=3. Clamped to 3. Risk raw is IMP (3) * likelihood (3) = 9. According to the dataset bins, 9 maps to risk=3. Since risk is 3, variant is \"threat.\"\n\nNow check rule consistency: likelihood equals exposure + vulnerability -1 (3=2+2-1 \u2192 3=3) \u2192 true.\n\nSo the final JSON should reflect these values. Let me make sure I didn't miss any mitigations. The scenario says \"unpatchable,\" but that's the vulnerability itself, not a mitigation. So no mitigations present, so VUL is 2.

The device in question is an HMI (Human-Machine Interface) with the EMB3D TID-306, which is categorized as application software and currently at the proof of concept stage. The scenario mentions that the HMI software has escaped sandboxed environments, as per EMB3D's description and evidence.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the exposure (EXP). The scenario doesn't explicitly state that the device is reachable remotely. It's possible that the sandbox escape could allow local access, but without mentions of remote access (like internet, VPN, DMZ, etc.), the exposure should be on-site only. So EXP is likely 2.\n\nNext, vulnerability (VUL). The scenario says there's a proof of concept (emb3d_maturity: proof of concept). According to the rules, a reliable PoC in a lab setting would set VUL to 2. There's no mention of active exploitation or a patch applied, so VUL is 2 here.\n\nImpact (IMP) is about the consequences. The scenario mentions the HMI software escaping sandboxed environments. Since HMIs are typically for user interface and monitoring, and without explicit mention of actuator manipulation or safety issues, the impact would be visibility/UI loss, which is IMP 3. However, if the sandbox escape leads to more severe consequences, but the scenario doesn't specify that, so sticking with IMP 3.\n\nNow, calculating likelihood. EXP is 2, VUL is 2. Likelihood raw is EXP + VUL -1 = 2+2-1=3. Clamped to 3, so likelihood is 3.\n\nRisk raw is IMP (3) multiplied by likelihood (3) = 9. According to the dataset bins, 9 maps to risk 3. Since risk is 3, the variant is \"threat\".\n\nCheck for mitigations. The scenario doesn't mention any mitigations like patches, services disabled, or firewalls, so no override here. The default applies. Also, no remote connectivity is stated, so EXP remains 2.\n\nRule consistency: likelihood equals 3, which is 2+2-1=3, so the flag is true.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should reflect these values with the correct variant and justification.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"variant\": \"threat\",\n  \"risk\": 3,\n  \"ilve\": {\n    \"impact\": 3,\n    \"likelihood\": 3,\n    \"vulnerability\": 2,\n    \"exposure\": 2\n  },\n  \"risk_raw\": 9,\n  \"justification\": \"EXP=2 (no remote cues, local/USB access implied); VUL=2 (proof-of-concept in lab); IMP=3 (sandbox escape impacts UI/visibility).

The device in question is an HMI (Human-Machine Interface) with the vulnerability of default credentials, as per the EMB3D description. The maturity level is \"observed adversarial technique,\" and the category is application software.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the MITIGATIONS. The problem statement doesn't mention any explicit mitigations like patches applied, services disabled, or firewalls blocking access. So, there's no mitigation override here. That means I can't set VUL to 1 based on mitigation. Since there's no mitigation, I need to check if there's active exploitation. The scenario says it's an observed adversarial technique, which might imply that it's being used in attacks, but the exact status isn't clear. However, the absence of mitigation and the presence of an observed technique could push VUL to 2 or 3. But wait, the maturity is \"observed adversarial technique,\" which according to the rules, might indicate that it's a known TTP (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures), which would fall under VUL=2. However, if it's actively exploited, it would be VUL=3. The scenario says \"observed adversarial technique,\" which aligns with VUL=2 as per rule 3, which states that a vendor advisory or observed TTP without active exploitation would be VUL=2. Since there's no mention of active exploitation, VUL=2.\n\nNext, EXPOSURE (EXP). The scenario doesn't specify if the HMI is remotely accessible. Default credentials might be exploited via local access or through a network. Since there's no explicit mention of remote connectivity (like internet, DMZ, etc.), we have to assume it's on-site or local. Therefore, EXP=2. The rules state that if remote isn't explicitly mentioned, EXP can't be 3. So EXP=2.\n\nIMPACT (IMP). The HMI's impact would depend on the consequence of the vulnerability. Default credentials could allow unauthorized access, but the scenario doesn't mention process outage, safety hazards, or actuator manipulation. It's more about access control. So the impact is likely on visibility or UI, which would be IMP=3. However, if the HMI allows control of processes, then it could be higher. But since the scenario only mentions default credentials without specifying process impact, I'll go with IMP=3 as per the rules (Visibility/UI loss).\n\nNow, calculating LIKELIHOOD. EXP=2, VUL=2.

The scenario doesn't mention any patches, services disabled, or mitigations. So, no MITIGATION override here. That means I have to look at the other factors.\n\nNext, CONNECTIVITY (EXP). The scenario says \"Unauthorized Messages or Connections,\" but it doesn't specify if it's remote or local. Since the rule says to never assume remote without explicit text, I have to default to lower EXP. The HMI is involved, which is usually on-site. So EXP might be 2 (on-site only). Unless there's a mention of remote access, which there isn't. So EXP=2.\n\nVULNERABILITY (VUL).

      "raw_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user provided a scenario about an HMI (Human-Machine Interface) with unpatchable device vulnerabilities based on EMB3D data. The task is to apply the given rules to determine the risk, variant, and other metrics.\n\nFirst, I need to check for mitigations. The scenario says the vulnerabilities are unpatchable. That's a key point. Since there's no patch applied, maybe the mitigation isn't present. But wait, the rules say to look for explicit mitigations first. Here, the scenario doesn't mention any mitigations like service disabled or firewall rules. So MITIGATION OVERRIDE doesn't apply here. \n\nNext, exposure (EXP). The scenario doesn't specify remote access. HMI is often on-site, but the user didn't state if it's air-gapped or isolated. The default for EXP without remote cues is 1 or 2. Since there's no mention of remote reachability, maybe EXP is 2 (on-site only). But wait, the example where HMI is on-site and service disabled had EXP=1 because of firewall. Here, there's no such info. So maybe EXP=2 (on-site/USB/serial). \n\nVulnerability (VUL). The scenario mentions \"Device Vulnerabilities Unpatchable\" and \"observed adversarial behavior\". Since there's no mitigation and adversarial behavior is observed, that might mean VUL=2 (Vendor advisory or PoC). But wait, the rules say VUL=3 if actively exploited. The scenario says \"observed adversarial behavior\", which could imply active exploitation. So VUL might be 3. But need to check if it's confirmed. The EMB3D maturity is \"observed adversarial behavior\", which might count as active exploitation. So VUL=3.\n\nImpact (IMP). HMI issues could affect process control. The scenario doesn't specify safety or process outage. Since it's an HMI, maybe it's about visibility/UI. If it's unpatchable and adversarial behavior observed, maybe it's process outage. But without explicit mention of actuator manipulation or production stop, IMP might be 3 (UI loss/visibility). However, if the adversarial behavior leads to process issues, maybe IMP=4. But the scenario is vague. The example with HMI on-site and diagnostics had IMP=2. Here, since it's unpatchable and adversarial behavior is observed, but no specific impact given, perhaps IMP=3 (UI/visibility) as a default. But if the adversarial behavior affects process control, it could be 4. The problem is the scenario is too vague. Since there's no explicit mention of process outage, I'll go with IMP=3.\n\nCalculating likelihood: EXP=2, VUL=3. Likelihood_raw=2+3-1=4. Clamped to 4. So LIK=4. Risk_raw=IMP*LIK=3*4=12. According to the bins, 12 maps to risk=3. Variant is \"threat\" since risk>2.\n\nWait, let me recheck. The scenario says \"unpatchable\" and \"observed adversarial behavior\". Adversarial behavior could mean active exploitation. So VUL=3. Exposure is on-site (EXP=2). Impact is 3. So risk_raw=3*4=12 \u2192 risk=3. Variant is threat.\n\nBut wait, the rules for IMP: if it's an HMI with adversarial behavior, maybe it's process outage. But without explicit mention, IMP=3 is safer. Also, the example with HMI on-site and diagnostics had IMP=2. Here, since it's unpatchable and adversarial behavior is observed, maybe the impact is higher. But without explicit safety or process outage, it's safer to stick with IMP=3. So final values:\n\nEXP=2, VUL=3, IMP=3.

It's an HMI, which is typically on-site. But the presence of unencrypted updates might imply some network exposure. However, without explicit mention of remote reachability (like internet, DMZ, etc.), I have to default to EXP=2 (on-site only). If there was a firewall or air-gapped, it would be lower, but there's no such info here.\n\nVULNERABILITY (VUL): The EMB3D maturity is proof of concept. That's a lab-level exploit. So VUL=2. Since there's no mitigation mentioned, and it's a PoC, that fits.\n\nIMPACT (IMP): The vulnerability is about unencrypted updates. This could lead to tampering, but the impact isn't specified as safety or process outage. It's more about data integrity. If the HMI is compromised, maybe it affects operator actions (UI), so IMP=3 (Visibility/UI loss). But if it's just diagnostics, maybe lower.

HMIs are often local, so EXP might be 2 (on-site only). Unless there's a mention of remote reachability, which there isn't, so EXP=2.\n\nVulnerability (VUL). The maturity is \"observed adversarial behavior,\" which suggests it's being exploited. But the scenario says \"observed adversarial behavior,\" which might mean it's in the wild. But wait, the EMB3D description says \"Firmware Update Rollbacks Allowed\"\u2014is that a known vulnerability? Since there's no mention of a patch or mitigation, VUL could be 2 or 3. Since there's observed adversarial behavior, maybe VUL=2 (vendor advisory or PoC) unless it's actively exploited. The term \"observed adversarial behavior\" might indicate that it's being exploited, so VUL=3? Wait, the rules say VUL=3 if actively exploited. The scenario says \"observed adversarial behavior,\" which could mean active exploitation. So VUL=3.\n\nImpact (IMP). Firmware rollback could allow an attacker to revert to a previous version with known vulnerabilities. For an HMI, this might affect the system's integrity, but unless it leads to process outage or safety issues, IMP is lower. The scenario doesn't mention process outage or safety, so maybe IMP=2 (diagnostics/minor inconvenience) or IMP=3 (visibility/UI loss). Since it's about firmware updates, maybe it's a security issue that could lead to unauthorized changes, but without direct process impact, IMP=2.\n\nCalculating LIK: EXP=2, VUL=3. LIK_raw = 2+3-1=4.

Variant is \"benign\" if risk \u22642. Wait, the rule says variant is \"benign\" if risk \u22642, else \"threat\". Here, risk is 2, so variant is \"benign\". \n\nWait, but the bins for 8 map to risk=2. So the risk is 2, which is \u22642, so variant is benign. Let me check again. The risk_raw is 8, which according to the dataset bins maps to risk=2. Then, variant is \"benign\" because risk is 2. So the final variant is \"benign\".\n\nJustification: Observed adversarial behavior suggests VUL=3. No remote access mentioned (EXP=2). Impact is minor (IMP=2).

      "raw_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by analyzing the given scenario. The device is an HMI with a known exploitable weakness in the form of a weak or insecure cryptographic protocol. The category is networking, and the maturity is listed as \"known exploitable weakness.\"\n\nFirst, I need to determine the exposure (EXP). The scenario doesn't mention anything about remote access or connectivity. It just states that the HMI software has a weak cryptographic protocol. Since there's no explicit mention of remote reachability (like internet, DMZ, etc.), the exposure should be either 1 or 2. Since it's an HMI, which is typically on-site, EXP is likely 2 (on-site only). But wait, the user's rules say that if remote is not explicitly stated, prefer EXP \u2208 {1,2}, not 3. Since the scenario doesn't mention remote, EXP is 2.\n\nNext, vulnerability (VUL). The scenario mentions a \"known exploitable weakness,\" which is a vendor advisory or confirmed TTP. According to the rules, that would make VUL=2. There's no mention of a patch applied or mitigation, so no override here. The weakness is present, so VUL is 2.\n\nFor impact (IMP), the scenario is about a cryptographic protocol weakness. The impact here is likely on the security of communications, which might affect diagnostics or data integrity but not process outage or safety. So IMP would be 2 (diagnostics/minor inconvenience) unless there's more. Since the problem is in networking and cryptographic protocols, it's probably not causing process outages or safety issues. So IMP=2.\n\nCalculating likelihood: EXP (2) + VUL (2) -1 = 3. Clamped to 3, so likelihood is 3. Risk raw is IMP (2) * likelihood (3) = 6. According to the risk bins, 6 maps to 2. So the variant is \"benign\" because risk is 2.\n\nNow check the rules again. Mitigation override: there's no mention of any mitigation, so VUL remains 2. Exposure is 2 because it's on-site. Impact is 2. The justification would be based on the known weakness, on-site exposure, and impact on diagnostics.

      "raw_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by breaking down the scenario provided. The device in question is a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller), which is critical in industrial control systems. The EMB3D details mention \"Device Vulnerabilities Unpatchable,\" and the maturity is \"observed adversarial behavior.\" The category is system software.\n\nFirst, I need to check for any explicit mitigations. The scenario states that the vulnerabilities are unpatchable. That's a key point. According to the rules, if there's a mitigation (like a patch applied), but it's ineffective or the vulnerability remains unpatched, then VUL might be higher. Since it's unpatchable, there's no effective mitigation here. So, looking at rule 3, VUL would be 2 if there's a vendor advisory or PoC. However, the scenario mentions \"observed adversarial behavior,\" which might indicate active exploitation. Wait, the scenario says \"observed adversarial behavior,\" which could imply that the vulnerability is being exploited. But the exact phrasing is \"Device Vulnerabilities Unpatchable \u2014 per EMB3D description/evidence.\" There's no explicit mention of active exploitation, weaponized CVE, or exploitation in the wild. The maturity is \"observed adversarial behavior,\" which might suggest that there's some exploitation happening. But the rules require explicit evidence for VUL=3. If it's just observed adversarial behavior without stating active exploitation, maybe VUL=2.\n\nNext, exposure (EXP). The scenario doesn't mention remote reachability. There's no indication that the PLC is accessible via internet, VPN, DMZ, etc. So, unless there's a statement about remote access, we default to EXP=2 (on-site only). The rules say to never assume remote without explicit text. So EXP=2.\n\nImpact (IMP). The device is a PLC, which controls physical processes. If exploited, it could lead to process outages or even safety hazards. However, the scenario doesn't specify the exact impact. The EMB3D category is system software, but the impact depends on the PLC's role. Since it's a PLC, potential impact could be high, but without explicit mention of process outage or safety hazard, we can't assume. The scenario only states that the vulnerabilities are unpatchable and adversarial behavior is observed. Without explicit safety or process impact, IMP might be 4 (process outage) if we infer based on PLC's role, but the rules say to avoid inflation unless explicit. Since there's no explicit mention, maybe IMP=3 (visibility/UI loss) or lower. Wait, the rules for IMP state that if there's no actuation or process effect, IMP is lower. The scenario doesn't specify any impact beyond the existence of the vulnerability. So perhaps IMP=2 (diagnostics/minor inconvenience) or even 1. But since it's a PLC, even a minor issue could be significant. However, without explicit evidence, the safe choice is to keep IMP low. Let's say IMP=2.\n\nNow, calculating likelihood. EXP=2, VUL=2. Likelihood_raw = 2+2-1=3. Clamped to 3. Risk_raw=IMP (2) * likelihood (3) = 6. According to the risk bins, 6 maps to risk=2. Therefore, variant is \"benign\" since risk is 2.\n\nCheck the rules again. Since the vulnerabilities are unpatchable, but there's no explicit mention of active exploitation (VUL=2), and EXP=2 (local). The impact is not explicitly high, so IMP=2. The calculation seems correct. The justification would include the unpatchable status, observed adversarial behavior (but not active exploitation), and local exposure with moderate impact.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"variant\": \"benign\",\n  \"risk\": 2,\n  \"ilve\": {\n    \"impact\": 2,\n    \"likelihood\": 3,\n    \"vulnerability\": 2,\n    \"exposure\": 2\n  },\n  \"risk_raw\": 6,\n  \"justification\": \"Unpatchable PLC vulnerability with observed adversarial behavior (VUL=2).

That means I don't get to set VUL to 1 from rule 1.\n\nNext, determine connectivity (EXP). The scenario says \"Firmware Update Rollbacks Allowed\" but doesn't specify remote access.

Wait, the rules say VUL=3 if actively exploited. The user's example 4 had a weaponized CVE and observed exploitation, so this might fit. So VUL=3.\n\nImpact (IMP): The vulnerability allows firmware rollbacks. What's the impact? If an attacker can roll back firmware, they might revert to a previous version with known vulnerabilities, potentially allowing further exploitation. But does this directly affect process control? The scenario doesn't mention actuator manipulation or safety hazards. It's a system software issue, so maybe IMP is 2 (diagnostics/minor inconvenience) or 3 (visibility/UI loss).

The device is a PLC, and the scenario is about code being overwritten to avoid detection, which is an observed adversarial technique. The EMB3D category is application software.\n\nStarting with MITIGATION. The scenario doesn't mention any explicit mitigations like patches applied, services disabled, or compensating controls. So, no mitigation override here. Since there's no mention of mitigation, we proceed to check for exposure and vulnerability.\n\nNext, EXPOSURE (EXP). The scenario doesn't specify if the PLC is reachable remotely. The only info is about code being overwritten. Since remote reachability isn't explicitly stated, EXP should be 1 or 2. Since it's a PLC, which is typically on-site, but without explicit info, maybe EXP=2 (on-site only). Wait, but if there's no info on remote access, the default is to choose 1 or 2. Since it's a PLC in an OT environment, maybe it's on-site, so EXP=2. But the rules say if remote isn't stated, choose 1 or 2. Since the scenario doesn't mention remote access, maybe EXP=2. Hmm, but if there's no mention of remote access, maybe it's 2 (on-site). But the example where no remote access is stated, EXP=1. Wait, the rules under EXP say: if remote is not explicitly stated, choose 1 or 2. But the example 1 had \"firewall denies ingress\" leading to EXP=1. Here, no such info. The scenario says \"PLC software: Code Overwritten to Avoid Detection\". No mention of remote access. So maybe EXP=2 (on-site only). \n\nVULNERABILITY (VUL). The scenario says it's an observed adversarial technique. The EMB3D maturity is \"observed adversarial technique\". According to the rules, VUL=2 if there's a vendor advisory, observed TTP, or reliable PoC. Since it's observed in the wild (adversarial technique), that would be VUL=2. The rules under VUL: if there's observed TTP, VUL=2. \n\nIMPACT (IMP). The scenario mentions code being overwritten to avoid detection. That's more about detection evasion, which might affect visibility or diagnostics. Since there's no mention of process outage or safety, IMP would be 2 (diagnostics/minor inconvenience). \n\nNow, calculating LIKELIHOOD. EXP=2, VUL=2. So LIK_raw = 2+2-1=3. Clamped to 3. \n\nRISK_RAW = IMP (2) * LIK (3) = 6. According to the dataset bins, 6 maps to risk=2. \n\nVARIANT: since risk is 2, variant is \"benign\".\n\nCheck rule consistency: likelihood is 3, which should be EXP+VUL-1 (2+2-1=3), so true.\n\nJustification: EXP=2 (on-site), VUL=2 (observed adversarial technique), IMP=2 (diagnostics).

The scenario doesn't mention any explicit mitigations like patches applied, services disabled, or firewalls blocking. So, no MITIGATION OVERRIDE here. \n\nNext, determine connectivity (EXP). The problem states it's a PLC, which typically might be on-site. But the scenario doesn't specify remote access. However, XSS usually requires user interaction via a web interface. If the PLC's web interface is accessible remotely, that would be EXP=3. But the scenario doesn't explicitly say it's reachable via the internet or a public IP. Since there's no mention of remote access, I should default to EXP=2 (on-site only). Wait, but XSS could be exploited if an attacker can get a user to click a malicious link. If the PLC's interface is only accessible locally, then EXP=2. But if it's accessible via a browser on the same network, maybe it's still local. Since the scenario doesn't specify remote reachability, EXP=2 is safer.\n\nVULNERABILITY (VUL): The category is \"known exploitable weakness\" and it's a XSS.

The maturity is a proof of concept, and the category is application software.\n\nFirst, I need to check for any explicit mitigations. The scenario doesn't mention any patches applied, services disabled, or compensating controls. So no MITIGATION OVERRIDE here. That means I can't set VUL to 1 unless there's a mitigation, which there isn't. Since the maturity is a proof of concept, that points to VUL being 2 because it's a lab-level exploit. But wait, the rules say VUL=2 if there's a vendor advisory, observed TTP, or reliable PoC. Here, it's a PoC, so VUL=2.\n\nNext, EXPOSURE (EXP). The scenario doesn't mention remote connectivity. It's just a PLC with HTTP issues. Since there's no explicit remote access, I have to default to EXP=2 (on-site only). Unless there's a mention of remote, which there isn't. So EXP=2.\n\nIMPACT (IMP). The vulnerability is in application software, leading to HTTP injection. The impact here would depend on what the exploit can do. Since it's a PLC, maybe it's about process control. But the scenario doesn't specify process outage or safety issues. It just mentions application software, so maybe the impact is on visibility or UI. That would be IMP=3. But wait, if it's a PLC, could it lead to actuator manipulation? The scenario doesn't say that. So sticking with IMP=3 as non-actuating, just UI or visibility loss.\n\nCalculating LIKELIHOOD: EXP (2) + VUL (2) -1 = 3. Clamped to 3, so likelihood is 3. Risk raw is IMP (3) * LIK (3) = 9.

That suggests it's a known vulnerability being used by attackers. But the scenario says \"hardcoded credentials\" which is a vulnerability, but is it actively exploited? The scenario doesn't say \"actively exploited\" or \"weaponized CVE\". It just mentions it's an observed adversarial technique. So maybe VUL=2 because it's a confirmed vulnerability with possible exploitation but not explicitly stated as active. Wait, the maturity is \"observed adversarial technique\", which might imply that it's being used. Hmm. If it's observed in the wild, then VUL=2. But if it's actively exploited, VUL=3.

That means I can't set VUL to 1 based on mitigations.\n\nNext, determine the connectivity (EXP). The scenario doesn't specify if the PLC is reachable remotely. It just says \"PLC software: Container Escape.\" Since there's no mention of remote access (like internet, VPN, DMZ, etc.), I have to default to EXP=2 (on-site only) because the anti-inflation rule says not to assume remote unless stated. \n\nFor VULNERABILITY (VUL), the maturity is \"known exploitable weakness,\" which suggests that there's a confirmed vulnerability but no explicit mention of active exploitation. Since there's no mitigation and it's a known exploitable issue, VUL would be 2 according to rule 3, which states that vendor advisory or reliable PoC (without active exploitation) sets VUL=2.\n\nIMPACT (IMP) is about the consequences. The scenario mentions a container escape, which typically allows an attacker to break out of a containerized environment. In a PLC context, this could lead to unauthorized access to the host system. However, there's no explicit mention of process outage, safety hazards, or actuator manipulation. The closest would be potential unauthorized access, but without specific impact details, I have to default to IMP=2 (diagnostics/minor inconvenience) unless there's evidence of higher impact.

The scenario says \"unpatchable,\" so there's no patch applied. There's no mention of any mitigation like service disabled or firewall rules. So, VUL is probably higher.\n\nNext, EXPOSURE (EXP). The scenario doesn't mention remote access. It just says \"device vulnerabilities unpatchable.\" Since there's no explicit remote reachability, EXP can't be 3. It might be 2 (on-site) unless there's something else. But the scenario doesn't specify, so I'll default to 2. Wait, but maybe there's no connectivity info. Wait, the rules say if remote isn't explicitly stated, EXP is 1 or 2. Since it's a PLC, maybe on-site. So EXP=2.\n\nVULNERABILITY (VUL). The scenario mentions \"observed adversarial behavior\" and \"unpatchable.\" Since there's no effective mitigation (can't patch), and if there's observed exploitation, VUL would be 3. But the user's dataset says \"emb3d_maturity: observed adversarial behavior.\" That might indicate that the vulnerability is being actively exploited. So VUL=3.\n\nIMPACT (IMP). The category is system software. The impact would depend on the PLC's role. Since it's a PLC, if exploited, it could lead to process outage or actuator manipulation. The scenario doesn't specify safety hazards, so maybe IMP=4 (process outage).\n\nNow, calculate LIK. EXP=2, VUL=3. LIK_raw = 2 +3 -1 =4. Clamped to 4. So LIK=4.\n\nRISK is IMP (4) * LIK (4) =16.

Since there's no mention of internet, DMZ, or public IP, I have to assume it's on-site. So EXP is 2 (on-site only). \n\nVULNERABILITY: The scenario says there's observed adversarial behavior and it's a system software issue. Since there's no mention of a patch or mitigation, VUL would be 2 because it's a confirmed vulnerability with possible exploitation but not necessarily active. Wait, the maturity is \"observed adversarial behavior,\" which might indicate that it's being exploited. But the scenario doesn't explicitly state active exploitation. Hmm. The rules say to only set VUL=3 if there's active exploitation. Since the scenario doesn't say \"actively exploited,\" maybe VUL is 2 here.\n\nIMPACT: The vulnerability allows firmware rollbacks. If an attacker can rollback firmware, they might disrupt the system or introduce vulnerabilities. This could lead to process outages or manipulation, which is IMP=4. But the scenario doesn't mention safety hazards, so maybe IMP=4 is correct. \n\nCalculating LIKELIHOOD: EXP=2, VUL=2. So likelihood_raw = 2+2-1=3. Clamped to 3. Risk_raw = 4*3=12. According to the bins, 12 maps to risk=3. Variant is \"threat\" because risk is 3. \n\nWait, let me check again. The scenario mentions \"observed adversarial behavior,\" which might imply active exploitation. If VUL is 3, then likelihood would be 2+3-1=4. Then risk_raw=4*4=16, which maps to risk=4. But the rules say to only set VUL=3 if there's active exploitation. The scenario says \"observed adversarial behavior,\" which could be exploitation. However, the exact wording is \"observed adversarial behavior,\" not \"actively exploited.\" The rules require explicit evidence of active exploitation.

Since it's application software and inconsistent code might affect operator guidance but not process outage, IMP=3 (Visibility/UI loss / operator guidance only).\n\nNow, calculate likelihood.

The EMB3D information says it's an observed adversarial technique under application software.\n\nFirst, looking for MITIGATIONS. The scenario doesn't mention any patches applied, services disabled, or compensating controls. There's no mention of air-gapping or firewall rules. So, no explicit mitigations here. That means I can't apply MITIGATION OVERRIDE, so I need to evaluate based on other factors.\n\nNext, CONNECTIVITY (EXP). The scenario doesn't specify if the PLC is remote or local. The only info is that the code is overwritten to avoid detection. Since there's no explicit mention of remote access (like internet, DMZ, etc.), I have to default EXP to 2 (on-site only, engineering WS, USB, etc.) because the anti-inflation rule says if remote isn't stated, choose 1 or 2. Since it's a PLC, maybe it's on-site, so EXP=2.\n\nVULNERABILITY (VUL). The scenario says it's an observed adversarial technique. According to the rules, if there's a vendor advisory or observed TTP, that's VUL=2. Since it's an observed technique but not explicitly stated as actively exploited (like in the wild), VUL=2.\n\nIMPACT (IMP). The scenario mentions code overwritten to avoid detection. That's more about detection evasion. The impact here isn't on process control (like actuator manipulation) or safety. It's more about the attacker hiding their presence. So IMP would be low. Since it's about detection, maybe diagnostics or UI, so IMP=2 or 3. The example given in the rules for diagnostics is IMP=2. Since it's about avoiding detection, which is a diagnostic or monitoring issue, IMP=2.\n\nNow calculate LIKELIHOOD. EXP=2, VUL=2. So LIKELIHOOD_RAW = 2+2-1=3.

That means I can't set VUL to 1 based on mitigation. \n\nNext, connectivity (EXP). The scenario states \"remotely accessible,\" which according to the rules, would be EXP=3 because it's explicitly remote. The rules say to never assume remote unless stated, which is the case here.\n\nVulnerability (VUL). Since there's no mention of a patch or mitigation, but it's an observed adversarial technique. That sounds like a confirmed TTP or PoC in the lab. So VUL would be 2. There's no indication of active exploitation in the wild, just that it's observed, so not VUL=3.\n\nImpact (IMP). The scenario doesn't mention any process outage, safety issues, or actuator manipulation. It's about unauthenticated services, which could be a security risk but without specific impact on operations. The closest would be IMP=2 (diagnostics/minor inconvenience) or maybe IMP=3 if it's about visibility.

The scenario mentions it's a proof of concept (emb3d_maturity: proof of concept). There's no mention of patches, services disabled, or firewalls, so MITIGATION OVERRIDE rule doesn't apply here. Since there's no mitigation, we move on.\n\nNext, determine connectivity (EXP). The scenario doesn't specify remote access. EMB3D categories like application software might imply local access, but the rules say to assume EXP 1-2 unless remote is explicit. The scenario doesn't mention remote reachability, so EXP is 2 (on-site only, maybe via USB or engineering workstation).\n\nVULNERABILITY (VUL): The maturity is proof of concept. Rule 3 says if there's a lab PoC, VUL is 2. Since it's a PoC but not weaponized or exploited in the wild, VUL is 2.\n\nIMPACT (IMP): The scenario is about password retrieval. If the PLC's password can be retrieved, that's a security issue but does it affect process or safety? The example mentions application software, so maybe it's about access control. The impact here would be on security, not direct process outage or safety. So IMP would be 2 (diagnostics/minor inconvenience) or maybe 3 if it's about visibility.

Risk raw is IMP (2) * likelihood (3) = 6. According to the risk bins, 6 maps to risk 2. So variant is benign since risk is 2.\n\nCheck the rules again. No mention of remote, so EXP is 2. No mitigation, so VUL is 2. IMP is 2. All calculations seem correct. Justification should mention the known exploitable weakness, on-site exposure, and impact level.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"variant\": \"benign\",\n  \"risk\": 2,\n  \"ilve\": {\n    \"impact\": 2,\n    \"likelihood\": 3,\n    \"vulnerability\": 2,\n    \"exposure\": 2\n  },\n  \"risk_raw\": 6,\n  \"justification\": \"EXP=2 (no remote access mentioned), VUL=2 (known exploitable weakness without mitigation), IMP=2 (application software flaw with no explicit process/safety impact).\",\n  \"rule_consistency\": {\n    \"likelihood_equals_exposure_plus_vulnerability_minus_1\": true\n  },\n  \"calc\": {\n    \"exp\": 2,\n    \"vul\": 2,\n    \"impact\": 2,\n    \"likelihood_raw\": 3,\n    \"likelihood_clamped\": 3,\n    \"risk_raw\": 6\n  }\n}",

      "raw_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this scenario step by step. The device is a PLC, and the issue is unencrypted sensitive data communication as per EMB3D. First, I need to determine the exposure (EXP). The scenario doesn't mention remote access explicitly. It just says \"PLC software: Unencrypted Sensitive Data Communication.\" Since there's no indication of remote reachability like internet, VPN, DMZ, etc., the exposure is likely local. So EXP would be 2 (on-site only).\n\nNext, vulnerability (VUL). The problem is that data is unencrypted, which is a known issue. The scenario mentions it's an \"observed adversarial technique,\" which suggests that there's a confirmed TTP or PoC. According to the rules, if there's a vendor advisory or observed TTP, VUL is 2. There's no mention of a patch or mitigation here, so VUL is 2.\n\nImpact (IMP) is about the consequences. Unencrypted data could lead to information disclosure, but the scenario doesn't specify any process outage or safety hazard. It's more about sensitive data being exposed, which might be a diagnostics or minor inconvenience. So IMP is probably 2.\n\nNow, calculate likelihood. EXP is 2, VUL is 2. Likelihood raw is 2 + 2 -1 = 3. Clamped to 3. Risk raw is IMP (2) * likelihood (3) = 6. According to the dataset bins, 6 maps to risk 2. Since risk is 2, the variant is \"benign.\"\n\nCheck for mitigations. The scenario doesn't mention any explicit mitigations like patch applied or service disabled. So MITIGATION OVERRIDE doesn't apply here. The VUL stays at 2.\n\nAlso, ensure that EXP isn't set to 3 without explicit remote cues. Since there's no mention of remote access, EXP remains 2. IMP is 2 because there's no process or safety impact mentioned. Everything seems consistent with the rules. The likelihood calculation checks out, and the risk mapping follows the bins correctly.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"variant\": \"benign\",\n  \"risk\": 2,\n  \"ilve\": {\n    \"impact\": 2,\n    \"likelihood\": 3,\n    \"vulnerability\": 2,\n    \"exposure\": 2\n  },\n  \"risk_raw\": 6,\n  \"justification\": \"EXP=2 (no remote access cues, local exposure); VUL=2 (observed adversarial technique, unencrypted data as confirmed TTP); IMP=2 (sensitive data exposure without process/safety impact).\",\n  \"rule_consistency\": {\n    \"likelihood_equals_exposure_plus_vulnerability_minus_1\": true\n  },\n  \"calc\": {\n    \"exp\": 2,\n    \"vul\": 2,\n    \"impact\": 2,\n    \"likelihood_raw\": 3,\n    \"likelihood_clamped\": 3,\n    \"risk_raw\": 6\n  }\n}",
